	    				For many years, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi and Pembroke Welsh Corgi were lumped together as a single breed. We don't even look alike. The Cardigan is bigger, heavier, and has a tail. If the Cardigan were human, they would drive trucks and bowl. The Pembroke is strictly white-collar management. However, this mistake was eventually corrected, and the two are now considered as completely separate breeds. Thus it does not fall to me to point out the obvious confusion.
